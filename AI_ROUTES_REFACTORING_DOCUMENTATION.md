### Routes (`/backend/routes/`)

#### **aiRoutes.js** (Refactored - Clean & Modular)
- **Lines**: Reduced from 847 to ~150 lines
- **Purpose**: Clean API endpoints using modular services
- **Features**: All original functionality maintained with improved organization

## üöÄ API Endpoints (Unchanged)

All API endpoints remain exactly the same for backward compatibility:

- `GET /api/ai/test` - Test AI connectivity
- `POST /api/files/upload` - Upload and process files
- `POST /api/ai/extract-cv` - Extract structured CV data
- `POST /api/ai/extract-job-offer` - Extract job requirements
- `POST /api/ai/tailor-cv` - Generate job-specific CV
- `POST /api/ai/generate-cover-letter` - Create cover letter
- `POST /api/download/cover-letter` - Generate cover letter PDF

## üéØ Key Improvements

### 1. **Maintainability**
- **Before**: 847 lines in single file
- **After**: Organized into 5 focused modules (~150 lines each)
- **Benefit**: Easier debugging, testing, and feature additions

### 2. **Reusability**
- **Before**: Tightly coupled code
- **After**: Independent services that can be used anywhere
- **Benefit**: Services can be reused in other parts of the application

### 3. **Testing**
- **Before**: Hard to unit test individual features
- **After**: Each service can be tested independently
- **Benefit**: Better test coverage and isolated testing

### 4. **Error Handling**
- **Before**: Mixed error handling throughout
- **After**: Centralized error handling in each service
- **Benefit**: Consistent error responses and better debugging

### 5. **Code Clarity**
- **Before**: Mixed concerns in single file
- **After**: Clear separation of responsibilities
- **Benefit**: Easier to understand and modify specific features

- **Better Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different services

## üîÑ Migration Process

### **Zero Downtime**
1. Original file backed up as `aiRoutes_original_backup.js`
2. New modular structure deployed without breaking changes
3. All existing API calls continue to work unchanged
4. Frontend requires no modifications

### **Backward Compatibility**
- All endpoints maintain exact same signatures
- Response formats unchanged
- Error handling improved but compatible
- All functionality preserved

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### **Using Individual Services**
```javascript
// Import specific service
const CVProcessingService = require('../services/ai/cvProcessingService');
const cvProcessor = new CVProcessingService();

// Extract CV data
const cvData = await cvProcessor.extractCVFromText(textContent);

// Tailor CV for job
const tailoredCV = await cvProcessor.tailorCV(cvData, jobOffer);
```

### **Using All Services**
```javascript
// Import all services
const { CVProcessingService, CoverLetterService } = require('../services/ai');

const cvProcessor = new CVProcessingService();
const letterService = new CoverLetterService();
```
