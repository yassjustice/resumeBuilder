      "endDate": "",
      "description": "",
      "location": ""
    }
  ],

üéØ EXPERIENCE POSITION EXTRACTION - CRITICAL:
- For the "position" field in experience entries, NEVER use "Intern" or "Trainee" as the job title
- Extract the actual role/function performed, not the employment classification
- BUT acknowledge internship status in the description field when relevant
- Examples: 
  * "Marketing Intern" ‚Üí Position: "Marketing Associate", Description: "Internship role focusing on..."
  * "Software Engineering Intern" ‚Üí Position: "Software Developer", Description: "Internship position developing..."
- Use industry-standard job titles that reflect the actual responsibilities
- Mention internship context naturally in the job description to maintain transparency

CRITICAL EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS:

üéØ JOB TITLE DETERMINATION - CRITICAL CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS:
- Analyze the ENTIRE CV to determine the most accurate professional title
- Consider: Career progression, experience level, primary expertise, industry, and current role
- DO NOT just copy the most recent job title - SYNTHESIZE from the whole career story
- Look at the full context: years of experience, progression pattern, skill set, achievements

üö® INTERNSHIP HANDLING - CRITICAL:
- NEVER use "Intern" as a job title - ALWAYS extract the actual role/function performed
- If someone is a "Marketing Intern" ‚Üí Position: "Marketing Assistant" or "Digital Marketing Associate"
- If someone is a "Software Engineering Intern" ‚Üí Position: "Software Developer" or "Junior Developer"  
- If someone is a "Data Science Intern" ‚Üí Position: "Data Analyst" or "Junior Data Scientist"
- ACKNOWLEDGE internship status in the job description naturally (e.g., "Internship role where I developed...")
- Focus on the ACTUAL WORK AND RESPONSIBILITIES, not the employment status
- Maintain transparency about internship context while using professional titles

ANALYSIS STEPS:
1. EXPERIENCE ANALYSIS: Review all work experience to identify career pattern and progression
   - Separate internships from full-time positions
   - Calculate total professional experience (including internships as partial experience)
   - Identify career progression trajectory from internships to full-time roles
2. SKILL ASSESSMENT: Examine skills to determine primary expertise and specialization 
3. SENIORITY EVALUATION: Calculate total years of experience and leadership indicators
   - Internships count as 0.5x experience (6-month internship = 3 months professional experience)
   - Full-time roles count as full experience
   - Consider progression: Intern ‚Üí Junior ‚Üí Mid-level ‚Üí Senior
4. INDUSTRY IDENTIFICATION: Determine the professional field/industry from experience
5. SPECIALIZATION FOCUS: Identify what they're most skilled/experienced in

TITLE GENERATION LOGIC (ENHANCED FOR MEANINGFUL ROLES):
- NEVER use "Intern" - always extract the actual role performed
- For current/recent internships: Use the actual job function (e.g., "Software Developer", "Marketing Specialist", "Data Analyst")
- Add seniority prefix based on total experience: "Junior [Role]" for 0-2 years, "[Role]" for 2-5 years, "Senior [Role]" for 5+ years
- Focus on what they DO, not their employment classification
- Examples: "Marketing Intern" ‚Üí "Digital Marketing Specialist", "Dev Intern" ‚Üí "Software Developer"

INTERNSHIP ROLE EXTRACTION EXAMPLES:
- "Marketing Intern at Company X" ‚Üí Position: "Digital Marketing Specialist", Description: "Internship role managing social media campaigns and analyzing customer engagement metrics..."
- "Software Engineering Intern" ‚Üí Position: "Software Developer", Description: "Internship position developing full-stack web applications using React and Node.js..."
- "Data Science Intern" ‚Üí Position: "Data Analyst", Description: "Internship role analyzing customer data and building predictive models..."
- "UX Design Intern" ‚Üí Position: "UX Designer", Description: "Internship position designing user interfaces and conducting usability testing..."
- "Business Analyst Intern" ‚Üí Position: "Business Analyst", Description: "Internship role conducting market research and process optimization..."
- "Finance Intern" ‚Üí Position: "Financial Analyst", Description: "Internship position performing financial modeling and investment analysis..."

EXAMPLES OF CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS:
- If someone has 5 years of React development + Node.js backend work ‚Üí "Full Stack Developer"
- If someone has 7 years across multiple frontend frameworks + team lead role ‚Üí "Senior Frontend Developer"
- If someone has 3 years React + 2 years mobile apps ‚Üí "Frontend & Mobile Developer"
- If someone has 6 years marketing + specializes in social media ‚Üí "Senior Digital Marketing Specialist"
- If someone has 4 years data analysis + Python/SQL expertise ‚Üí "Data Analyst"
- If someone has 8 years + manages teams + various tech projects ‚Üí "Senior Technical Lead"

INTERNSHIP CONTEXTUAL EXAMPLES:
- Marketing intern who managed social media campaigns ‚Üí Position: "Social Media Marketing Specialist", Description: "Internship role developing and executing social media strategies..."
- Software engineering intern who built full-stack applications ‚Üí Position: "Full Stack Developer", Description: "Internship position building web applications using modern frameworks..."
- Data science intern who created ML models ‚Üí Position: "Machine Learning Engineer", Description: "Internship role developing predictive models and data analysis pipelines..."
- Finance intern who performed financial analysis ‚Üí Position: "Financial Analyst", Description: "Internship position conducting financial modeling and market research..."
- Design intern who created user interfaces ‚Üí Position: "UI/UX Designer", Description: "Internship role designing user experiences and conducting user research..."
- Business development intern who conducted market research ‚Üí Position: "Business Analyst", Description: "Internship position analyzing market trends and competitive landscape..."

CAREER PROGRESSION RECOGNITION:
- Intern ‚Üí Junior ‚Üí Regular ‚Üí Senior progression should be reflected in title
- Don't penalize someone for starting with internships - focus on their current capabilities
- Consider the trajectory: someone who interned 5 years ago and now has senior responsibilities should have a senior title
- Internships show initiative and early career development, not current skill level

AVOID GENERIC TITLES:
‚ùå "Professional", "Specialist", "Expert", "Consultant" (unless that's their actual role)
‚ùå Just copying the field name like "Information Technology" or "Marketing"
‚ùå Overly broad titles that don't reflect their specific expertise

üö® CRITICAL TITLE EXTRACTION MISTAKES TO AVOID:
‚ùå Using "Intern" as any part of the job title
‚ùå Using generic terms like "Intern", "Trainee", "Student" as job titles
‚ùå Ignoring the actual work performed during internships
‚ùå Not extracting meaningful professional roles from internship descriptions
‚ùå Defaulting to "Intern" when the person performed real professional work

‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH FOR ROLE EXTRACTION:
‚úÖ Extract the actual job function and responsibilities performed
‚úÖ Use professional, industry-standard job titles
‚úÖ Focus on WHAT they did, not their employment status
‚úÖ Analyze the job description/responsibilities to determine the real role
‚úÖ Use context clues from technologies, tasks, and achievements to determine precise titles
‚úÖ MAINTAIN TRANSPARENCY: Include internship context naturally in job descriptions
‚úÖ Balance professionalism with honesty about the nature of the experience

üîç TRANSPARENCY GUIDELINES:
- Job Title: Professional role (e.g., "Software Developer")
- Job Description: Natural mention of internship context (e.g., "Internship role where I...")
- Keep the experience honest while presenting it professionally
- Acknowledge the learning/development aspect when relevant
- Show progression and growth throughout the internship experience

PRIORITIZE ACCURACY AND RELEVANCE:
‚úÖ Reflect their actual level of experience and expertise
‚úÖ Match their primary area of specialization
‚úÖ Include appropriate seniority level
‚úÖ Use industry-standard professional titles
‚úÖ Consider their career trajectory and current capabilities

üè∑Ô∏è SKILLS CATEGORIZATION:

- Analyze the person's field/industry from their experience and create relevant categories
- Do NOT use generic fixed categories - adapt to the individual's profession and skill set

- Each skill should ONLY have the name - NO LEVELS NEEDED
- Skills object structure: { "CategoryName": ["SkillName1", "SkillName2", "SkillName3"] }
- Categories should be descriptive, professional, and FIELD-SPECIFIC

EXAMPLES BY FIELD:
- Software Developer: "Programming Languages", "Frameworks & Libraries", "Development Tools", "Databases", "Cloud Platforms"
