# ü§ñ AI Prompt Enhancement Guide

This document provides detailed instructions on where and how to modify AI system prompts to implement the following enhancements:

1. **Skills Categorization**: Let AI automatically categorize skills into proper categories
2. **Professional Summary**: Let AI generate/enhance professional summaries
3. **Job Title Setup**: Let AI determine and set appropriate job titles

---

## üìç **FILE LOCATIONS FOR AI PROMPTS**

All AI prompts are located in: `backend/routes/aiRoutes.js`

### **Key AI Model Used**
- **Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
- **API**: Google Gemini AI
- **Environment Variable**: `GEMINI_API_KEY`

---

## üéØ **ENHANCEMENT 1: SKILLS CATEGORIZATION**

### **Target Location**

- **Function**: `POST /api/ai/extract-cv` endpoint
- **Line Range**: ~180-220 (approximate)
- **Current Prompt Variable**: `prompt` (inside the router.post('/extract-cv'))

### **Current Skills Structure**
```javascript
"skills": [
  {
    "name": "",
    "level": "Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced|Expert"

## üõ†Ô∏è **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues**

1. **JSON Parsing Errors**
   - Check that the JSON structure is valid
   - Ensure all brackets and quotes are properly closed
   - Test with a simple CV first

2. **Skills Not Categorized**
   - Verify the instructions are clear in the prompt
   - Check that the AI model is receiving the updated prompt
   - Test with different types of skills

3. **Missing Job Titles**
   - Ensure the title field is added to personalInfo
   - Check that the AI has enough context to infer a title
   - Verify the instructions are specific enough

### **Debug Steps**
1. Check server logs for AI responses
2. Test individual endpoints with Postman
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Check that the Gemini API key is valid

## üìù **NOTES**

- All modifications are in the same file: `backend/routes/aiRoutes.js`
- The AI model `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` is capable of following complex instructions
- Test incrementally - implement one enhancement at a time
- Keep backups of working versions
- Monitor API usage to stay within limits
- Consider adding validation for the new structured data
